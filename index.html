                    I put the shotgun in an Adidas bag and padded it out with four pairs of tennis socks,
                    not my style at all, but that was what I was aiming for:
                    If they think you're crude, go technical; if they think you're technical, go crude.
                    I'm a very technical boy. So I decided to get as crude as possible.
                    These days, thought, you have to be pretty technical before you can even aspire to crudeness.
                    I'd had to turn both those twelve-gauge shells from brass stock, on the lathe, and then load then myself;
                    I'd had to dig up an old microfiche with instructions for hand-loading cartridges;
                    I'd had to build a lever-action press to seat the primers -all very tricky.
                    But I knew they'd work.
